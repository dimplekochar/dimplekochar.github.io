  <li><p><strong>HKMG Stack Process Impact on Gate Leakage, SILC and PBTI</strong> [Dec '18 - Oct '20] <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9405154">[Paper]</a> <a href="https://dimplekochar.github.io/files/irps.pdf">[Presentation]</a> <br />

  Stress Induced Leakage Current (SILC) and Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) remained as the forerunner in the device reliability domain with the continuous transistor 
    scaling; PBTI remains a concern for N-MOSFETs. Bulk trap generation in HK for PBTI stress is estimated from SILC measurements. Recently, RD and RDD models are used for NBTI interface and bulk
trap generation in PMOS.<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8330761">*</a>
 This project aims to model direct tunneling leakage, SILC and PBTI along
with the bulk traps generated and PBTI trap generation at IL/HK interface in NMOS with deeply scaled (down to EOT∼7Å) HKMG stacks.

  <li><p><strong>Time to Failure Distribution of a Stored Bit in SRAM due to RTN</strong>  [Dec '18 - Nov '20] <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9401180">[Paper]</a> <a href="https://dimplekochar.github.io/files/iscas.pdf">[Presentation]</a><br />

   Trapping and detrapping of charges in the oxide interface of a MOSFET leads to a
random telegraphic noise (RTN) injection and this phenomenon negatively affects the reliability of
circuits. The objective of this project is to develop a reproducible strategy to obtain TTF distribution
and related statistics for an SRAM cell of any technology with any given RTN model.
  <ul>
        <p><p><li>
    Proposed a method to estimate TTF distribution of a stored bit in an SRAM cell due to single
or multi-level RTN by composition of Monte-Carlo simulations and circuit-level abstraction    </li>
      <li>
    Showcased results of this procedure on an SRAM cell made from 45 nm technology with a single-
trap RTN model at various supply voltages using Cadence, Ocean and Python scripting    </li>
    <li>
   Indicated via circuit-level simulations that the TTF distribution worsens due to process variations 
    </li>

<li><p><strong>Dipole-Exchange Spin Waves for Thin Ferromagnetic Films</strong> [May '19 - Jul '19] <a href="https://dimplekochar.github.io/files/delft.pdf">[Presentation]</a>

    Surface spin waves (dipole) are chiral and exist only in thick magnetic films with small group velocities. Exchange waves are non chiral with high velocities at higher frequencies.
      Dipole-exchange spin waves exist in the middle of these two ends of wave vector range. Dispersion characteristics of spin waves in ferromagnetic films taking into account both
the dipole-dipole and the exchange interactions are obtained by a sixth-order differential equation. The objective of this project is to solve it considering pinned and unpinned boundary conditions and
study their variation with thickness in this transition region.
      <ul>
        <p><p>
      <li>
        Calculated the wave function, magnetization and dipolar field profiles for various modes of spin
waves for given film thickness by solving Landau–Lifshitz and Maxwells’ equations and appropriate boundary conditions</li>
    <li>
        Showed how chirality changes with thickness; obtained the dispersion relation (&omega; vs k&#8407;) for a film
    </li>
        <li>
      Obtained isofrequency curves and showed their change with increase in magnetic field in k&#8407; space</li>

 <p><li><strong> Model for Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) for ultrathin oxides</strong> [May '18 - Present] <br />
<em>Advisor: Prof. Souvik Mahapatra, Electrical Engineering , IIT Bombay</em> <br /> 
  
  TDDB is a failure mechanism in MOSFETs, when the gate oxide breaks down as a result of long-time application of relatively low electric field. 
Time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) follows the Weibull distribution and is characterized by &#946;, the Weibull slope.
In this project, the change in the slope is explained by a percolation model with different defect
generation rates in the bulk and channel/oxide and gate/oxide interfaces, also considering SILC slope and trap size
changes with thickness. The model is then extended for high-k with interfacial SiO<sub>2</sub>.
  <ul>
        <p><p><li>Constructed a cell based MOSFET percolation model which generates bulk and interface traps with varied defect generation rates
and procured the time at which a percolation path emerges using Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm in C++
      </li>
      <li>
    Obtained time to failure distribution and analysed the relation of its Weibull slope with oxide
thickness and obtained results obeying empirical claims and experimental data; verified area scaling
    </li>
    <li>
      Extending the model to a bilayer stack and including the effect of PBTI generated interface traps
