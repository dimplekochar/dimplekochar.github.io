<ol><li><p><strong>Department Academic Mentor</strong> (Apr  ’19 - May '21) <br /> 
  <em>Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay</em> <br /> 
I was selected as a student mentor, through extensive peer reviews and interviews, to help academically weak students to improve and maximize the academic potential of all students. 
  I am also obligated to identify problems of the general student populace and bring them to the notice of the concerned authorities. Last year, I was responsible 
  for mentoring and motivating 4 students and playing a key role in their overall development. This year I am responsible for 7 students.</p></li>

  <em>Insight, IIT Bombay</em> <br /> 
Insight is the official print student media body of IIT Bombay, circulated to 10,000+ students and 650+ faculty members with an online readership of over 0.4 million.
    I was part of the 22 member team responsible for managing Insight. I was awarded the Institute Journalism Special Mention award for my contribution. I led various initiatives like interviewing professors for the 'Know Your Prof' video series to enhance
    student-faculty interaction and spearheading the University Series by contacting and collecting testimonials from IIT Bombay students doing their
graduate degree abroad, along with writing opinion pieces and information dissemination articles.</p></li>
