I am a PhD student in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I am fortunate to have [Prof. Anantha Chandrakasan](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/people/anantha-chandrakasan/) and [Prof. Hae-Seung Lee](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/people/hae-seung-harry-lee/) as my PhD advisors. My research interests lie broadly in creating energy-efficient circuits for AI and, in turn, utilizing GenAI for circuit design, be it in generation, optimization, or performance prediction. I believe that by creating better chips for AI, we enable more powerful and efficient models, which, in turn, support the development of the next generation of chips.

I graduated with a B.Tech and an M.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay, where I was awarded the [Sharad Maloo Memorial Gold Medal](https://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/RulesforAwardofMedalsandAcademicprizesforUGandPG.pdf) for being the second-most outstanding student in terms of general proficiency, excellence in academic performance, extracurricular activities, and social services among all B.Tech/Dual Degree graduating students (1 in 999) at the 59th Convocation of IIT Bombay.

I was fortunate to have [Prof. Souvik Mahapatra](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/souvik?s=model) as my Master's Thesis advisor. We worked on electrical characterization, modeling, and simulation of Stress-Induced Leakage Current (SILC), Positive Bias Temperature Instability (PBTI), and other reliability concerns in micro/nanoelectronic devices. Using a percolation model, we also modeled Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) of very thin oxides. 

I spent the summer of 2023 with the Memory IP team at Qualcomm in San Diego. We filed a patent application on our work on making in-memory computing reliable.

I spent the summer of 2019 at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), where I was hosted by [Prof. Gerrit Bauer](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/quantum-nanoscience/prof-dr-gerrit-bauer/) and [Prof. Yaroslav Blanter](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/quantum-nanoscience/prof-dr-yaroslav-blanter/) at the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience. We worked on dipole-exchange spin waves for thin ferromagnetic films.  

I have also worked with [Prof. Animesh Kumar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~animesh/) on an independent study project. We developed a method to obtain the time to failure distribution for any SRAM cell with any given RTN model.
