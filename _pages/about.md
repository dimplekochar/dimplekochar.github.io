**I am on the job market, looking for full-time industry research positions in Summer 2026. If you see a good fit and are interested in hiring, please reach out via email.**

I am a final year PhD student in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I am fortunate to have Prof. Anantha Chandrakasan and Prof. Hae-Seung Lee as my PhD advisors. I have been awarded the Grass Instrument Company Fellowship and the MathWorks Engineering Fellowship.

My research interests lie broadly in creating **energy-efficient accelerators for AI** and, in turn, utilizing **GenAI for chip design**, be it in circuit generation, sizing optimization, verification or performance prediction. I believe that by creating better chips for AI, we enable more powerful and efficient models, which will support the development of the next generation of chips.

I graduated with a B.Tech and an M.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay, where I was awarded the Sharad Maloo Memorial Gold Medal for being the second-most outstanding student among all B.Tech/Dual Degree graduating students (1 in 999) at the 59th Convocation of IIT Bombay.

In Summer 2025, I interned at NVIDIA Research as part of the ASIC and VLSI Research (AVR) group on using LLMs for RTL verification. Previously, I have interned at Qualcomm (Summer 2023) and TU Delft (Summer 2019).
