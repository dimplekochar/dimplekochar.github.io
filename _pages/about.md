I am a second year PhD student at the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I am fortunate to have [Prof. Anantha Chandrakasan](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/people/anantha-chandrakasan/) as my PhD advisor. My research interests lie broadly in the areas of energy efficient circuits and systems for ML applications, and computer architecture.

I graduated with a B.Tech and an M.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay where I was awarded the Sharad Maloo Memorial Gold Medal for being the most outstanding student in terms of extra-curricular activities along with academic performance. 

I was fortunate to have [Prof. Souvik Mahapatra](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/souvik?s=model) as my Master's Thesis advisor. We worked on electrical characterization, modeling and simulation of Stress Induced Leakage Current (SILC), Positive Bias Temperature Instability (PBTI) and other reliability concerns in micro/nano electronic devices. Apart from that, we also modelled Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) of very thin oxides using a percolation model. 

I spent a summer in 2023 with the Memory IP team at Qualcomm in San Diego. I worked on making in-memory computing reliable.

I spent a summer in 2019 at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), where I was hosted by [Prof. Gerrit Bauer](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/quantum-nanoscience/prof-dr-gerrit-bauer/) and [Prof. Yaroslav Blanter](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/quantum-nanoscience/prof-dr-yaroslav-blanter/), at the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience. We worked on dipole-exchange spin waves for thin ferromagnetic films.  

I have also worked with [Prof. Animesh Kumar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~animesh/) on an independent study project. We developed a method to obtain the time to failure distribution for any SRAM cell with any given RTN model.
