I was selected as a student mentor, through extensive peer reviews and interviews, to help weak students to improve and maximize the academic potential of all students. I am also obligated to identify problems of the general student populace and bring them to the notice of the concerned authorities. Last year, I was responsible for mentoring and motivating 4 students and playing a key role in their overall development. This year I am responsible for 9 students.
